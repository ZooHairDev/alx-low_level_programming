# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
## Introduction/Objective
* To know when and why using linked lists vs arrays
* To know how to build and use linked lists

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc**, using the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89**
* All files ends with a new line
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are compiled using the **Betty style**
* The only C standard library functions allowed are **malloc**, **free** and **exit**.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function **_putchar** should be included in your header file called lists.h
* All header files were include guarded
